HOWTO

# Add a rendering test: 
  - create the svg file
  - inkscape <yourfile>.svg -d 96  -e expected_rendering/<yourfile>.png
  - inkscape <yourfile>.svg -d 384 -e expected_rendering/<yourfile>-large.png
  - add the test in CMakeLists.txt
  - use stable if possible to generate the reference png files
  - git add <yourfile>.svg expected_rendering/<yourfile>-large.png expected_rendering/<yourfile>.png
  
# Fix a failing test (due to a change in code):
  - DO *NOT* MODIFY the expected rendering (or the svg) before getting advice from inkscape-devel@
  - fix your code if possible
  - IF you change introduces a greater compatibility with css or browsers
    - AND you cannot reasonably "update" files from older versions to match the appearance
      - AND inkscape-devel@ has a consensus that it's the only way
        -> do as you must
  - manually double check the changes

# Fix a failing test (due to a change in pixman or cairo):
  - update renderings. Use a *stable* version to generate the renderings, NOT TRUNK
  - manually check appearances
